        <p>I pride myself on being able to communicate clearly and effectively, using self-deprecating humor, wild analogies and common Portuguese sayings in order to get a point across. Over the past few years I've done quite a few <a href="/mediatimeline">talks and presentations</a>, ranging from academic talks, keynotes at industry events, or simple panels on Information Security. If you're interested in having me speak at your next event, feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/diogomonica">Twitter</a>, or Gmail me at diogo.monica.</p>
