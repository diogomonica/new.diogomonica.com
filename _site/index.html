						<p><em>I believe that React.js and flux architecture is where the industry is headed for years to come.</em> I believe it so much that I scooped up an in-person ticket to <a href="http://reactweek.com">React Week</a>. This is a big deal for me because it completely ruins my chance of getting a drone for my birthday in June, which I have wanted for years now.

						<h2 id="installing-system-fonts-is-trickier-than-you-would-think">Installing system fonts is trickier than you would think</h2>
<p>At least that is the case for Windows OS. During early stage development of RenderEffects, I really did not put much thought into installing font on the system. At the time it seemed as trivial as copy/pasting into the font directory right? Nerp! Even if you give your Node program system privileges, it just will not work. It turns out the only way to do it is with Windows powershell scripting. That kind of turned me off from writing it myself, so I was hoping there would already be something available on npm or Github that I could use or at least modify. But, It appeared, I was the only person in need of a system font installation module.

						<h2 id="frugal-wordpress-setup">Frugal Wordpress setup</h2>
<p>When you want to setup a wordpress server with decent performance at a low cost, nothing beats digital ocean. This is of course my opinion, but $5/month is hard to beat! The only caveat is 512mb of memory.

						<h2 id="sink-or-swim">Sink or swim</h2>
<p>Sink or swim is usually the case when I join a team. Most recently I have been engaged with TwinTech developing full stack JavaScript for Under Armour. I have to say, the most initial friction was caused by my Git habits. Things like ugly Git history and weird commits sneaking into my branches. The good news is the team has been super helpful by helping me become more savvy with my Git habits. These habits are what I would like to share with you.
